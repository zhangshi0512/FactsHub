Submitted by: **Shi Zhang**

This web app: **allows users to share different types of facts, vote and comment on existing facts. The user can also edit or delete existing facts by entering the secret key, which is set when the fact is posted.**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **A create form that allows the user to create posts**
- [x] **Posts have a title and optionally additional textual content and/or an image added as an external image URL**
- [x] **A home feed displaying previously created posts**

- [x] **Clicking on a post shall direct the user to a new page for the selected post**
- [x] **Users can sort posts by either their created time or upvotes count**
- [x] **Users can search for posts by title and textual content**
- [x] **A separate post page for each created post, where any additional information is shown is linked whenever a user clicks a post**
- [x] **Users can leave comments underneath a post on the post's separate page**
- [x] **Each post should have an upvote button on the post's page. Each click increases its upvotes count by one and users can upvote any number of times**

- [ ] Users can customize the interface of the web app
- [ ] Users can share and view web videos
- [x] Users can set flags while creating a post. Then users can filter posts by flags on the home feed.
- [ ] Users can upload images directly from their local machine as an image file
- [ ] Display a loading animation whenever data is being fetched

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
